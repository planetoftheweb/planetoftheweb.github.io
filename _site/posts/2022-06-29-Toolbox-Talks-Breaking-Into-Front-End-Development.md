We talk to Christina Truong with more than 10 years in the web development industry, we talk about going to school for Psychology and how that ended up helping her with her career as a developer. How a 14 week program gave her a quick start in the industry and how she went from being a Junior Developer to a Tech Lead. Then we cover her experience with Ladies Learning Code as well as how her work at Agencies helped her grow her career.

We cover how to approach learning and when to pick up new technologies, how important soft skills are. We learn when she teaches her students about Stack Overflow. Then we get into her courses on Git, freelancing, Design systems and more.
