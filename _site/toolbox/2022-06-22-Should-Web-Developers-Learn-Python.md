summary: "In this episode of The Toolbox, I'm debuting something I'm calling Toolbox Talks. That's conversations with Web and Teaching professionals. I'll share my interview with Ronnie Sheer, who is hanging around in the Chat ready to answer your questions about Python, breaking into the industry, all of the full stack tools he uses.

Hello everyone this is Ray Villalobos and I stream about front-end and full stack tools Wednesdays at 1pm Eastern â€¢ 10am Pacific. Follow me and subscribe on LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube for more content. If you want to watch any past episodes, make sure you take a look at my blog raybo.org.

## Turn on the Bell Icon
If you want to keep up with what I'm up to, the best way to do that is to to [my profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/planetoftheweb/) and click on the bell icon. It's not something you can see on your own profile, but it would be right where the pencil edit icon would be.

## Audio Conversations
Last week, my friends Morten Rand Hendriksen, Simon Saint-Laurent and I tried one of the new LinkedIn features...Audio Conversations.


# Toolbox Talks

So I've been mentioning that I wanted to try something new on this stream. I've met some amazing people over the years working at LinkedIn and Lynda.com and I wanted to have an opportunity to talk to them about breaking into the industry, their thoughts on education, the stack...which is the frameworks and tools they use and more.

I did [a poll](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/planetoftheweb_webdeveloper-webdesign-html-ugcPost-6940641539337416704-z12u) a few weeks ago about this and the results were a bit mixed with New Frameworks and Libraries being first on the list followed by Tips and then Interviews. 

I would really love to get some feedback on what you like about the show and where you'd like it to go.

We'll, today I'll be sharing a conversation I had with Ronnie Sheer, Head of Research and Development at Hiverr and Author of several courses on Python, CoPilot and Git.

I have some more interviews on the way, so let me know what you think in the chat. Both he and I will be answering questions while his interview plans and then hopefully we'll have time for a Q&A.


# Wrapup
## GitHub CoPilot Releases
One thing I did want to mention that we did talk about in the interview is that [CoPilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/) has released this week. $10/month and that would be on top of your GitHub subscription if you have one, but it's independent. It's available for individuals, but not companies yet.

## QA

# Coming Soon
A bit of news, I'll be going on vacation in about a couple of weeks around July 4th, so next week, I'll do another Toolbox Talk with [Christina Truong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinatruonpm startng/) where we talk about her career, features in CSS she's excited about. Flexbox versus Grid and other great topics.

Then, I'll be gone for a couple of weeks and then I'll be back. I'm really trying to figure out what framework I get to cover next...lots of cool stuff out there. See you next week!
