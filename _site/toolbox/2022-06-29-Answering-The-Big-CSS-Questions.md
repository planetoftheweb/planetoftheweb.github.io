## Toolbox Talks

So, last week, I launched a new series of Talks, I'm calling [Toolbox Talks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1ezw_kTxXOm-x2kWZBRI5MMMxNDGHM4v) and I had a great interview with Ronnie Sheer about Python.

This week, I'm continuing that talking to Christina Truong, who's in the chat ready to answer your questions about CSS. I'll play an interview I did with her and then we'll both come on and answer questions.

Christina does a huge variety of courses on LinkedIn. Everything from getting a job, to Git, design systems and one of our most popular courses on LinkedIn learning. CSS Essential Training with 176k learners.
